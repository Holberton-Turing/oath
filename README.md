# ABOUT THE HOLBERTON-TURING OATH

**The Holberton-Turing Oath** is made to gather all AI experts in the world around shared values and moral to drive them to use their skills by insuring their integrity and by avoiding any threat to any life being.

AI becomes an important piece in driving innovation in most of the fields and soon all of them; from engineering, education, medicine, journalism, economy, marketing, finance, agriculture to social sciences for instance. We, as AI experts, have the duty, in close collaboration with citizens, corporates and governments, to make AI safe and inclusive without regard to ethnicity, gender,  culture, language, sexual orientation or age.

**The Holberton-Turing Oath** is made toward evolving at any time from mutual contributions from AI experts but also philosophers, economists, leaders and any citizen in general.
