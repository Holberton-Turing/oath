- I will not use my knowledge to violate human rights and civil liberties, even under threat;

## Data Science, Art of Artificial Intelligence, Privacy & Personal Data :

- I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those scientists and engineers in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow;
- I will remember that there is an art to Artificial Intelligence as well as science, and that human concerns outweigh technological ones;
- I will respect the privacy of humans for their personal data are not disclosed to Artificial Intelligence systems so that the world may know;
- I will remember that I am not encountering dry data, mere zeros and ones, but human beings, whose interactions with my Artificial Intelligence software may affect the personâ€™s freedom, family, or economic stability;

- I will share my knowledge for the benefit of the people and the advancement of Data-Science and Artificial Intelligence;
- I will consider the impact of my work on fairness both in perpetuating historical biases, which is caused by the blind extrapolation from past data to future predictions, and in creating new conditions that increase economic or other inequality;
- I make these promises to create Artificial Intelligence, first, to collaborate with people for the greater good, rather than usurp the human role and supplant them;
- I make these promises solemnly, freely, and upon my honor.
